    "\n",
    "### Deadline: Wednesday 22nd of March, 11:00 am\n",
    "\n",
    "- For this exercise you will need Jupyter Notebook and the python packages *numpy*, *xarray*, *cartopy* & *matplotlib*, which you probably already installed for the previous exercises. \n",
    "- Hand in the assignment as a single Jupyter Notebook, in PDF format, on Blackboard.\n",
    "- This is an individual assignment. Make sure to include your name and student number in your notebook.\n",
    "- The submission deadline is **Wednesday the 22nd of March** at **11:00 am**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment consists of two parts, in which you will answer several subquestions. In Part 1, you will compute the Sverdrup streamfunction from the wind stress and compare it to satellite data. In Part 2, you will use satellite observations of the sea level to investigate temporal variability in the ocean circulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your grade for this assignment will be your number of points divided by 10. You can earn a total of 100 points. The number of points that you can earn for each question is indicated at the start of the question. The quality of your figures will contribute up to 5 points per question, so make sure to include clear figure titels, labels (including units) and legends and use appropriate map projections, colormaps and colorbars. Limit your answer to each question to 50-100 words.  "

However, due to variability in the climate system, the ocean circulation varies over time as well (=temporal variability). As you have seen in Exercise **A04**, the sea level, which can be observed globally with satellites, depends on the ocean circulation.
